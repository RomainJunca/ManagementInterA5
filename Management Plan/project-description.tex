The main goal is to install a toothbrush production line in the eco-city of Taijin in China.
Our company is workig for \moldco to make this production line a reality.

Ou main guidelines in this project is to install a production line that can produce a great amount of toothbrushes within an eco-city.
This project needs to be respectful of the surrounding environnement and social aspects of the project's stakeholders.

\subsection{Specifications}

This project has to achieve the following specifications.

The production line must contains all the required machines to automate the production of toothbrushes.
Theses machines include moulting machine, stamping machine, tufting machine, bristle cutter machine, bristle trimming machine and Packaging machine.
These machines need to be bought and connected to each other in order to build the full product.

To connect all the machines in the assembly line, the project requires also a full digital connection to an internal network.
This network group all connected machines and database servers to store monitoring informations about the production.
These informations need to represent the current production, the past production and potential errors in the production line.

The production line is fully automated throw this network and the production is regulated to produce exactly what is needed.
This automatisation brings many advantages including the environmental impact reduction, reduction of the storage requirement of finished products and 24/7 production in case of huge demand.

The informations collected need to be displayed to the employees in charge of the production line.
These informations are displayed throught an interface reading the monitoring data from the database.
A master server has to be installed in order to control all machines and to control the production flow.

Several materials are required to produce toothbrushes.
These materials are plastic, nylon, brass wire, paper box packing, plastinc hard container packaging, high frequency blister packaging and Blister card packaging.
The project must include a storage space for all these material and human resources to load the resources in the appropriate machines.

All the production line machines, storage and digital network requires engineering the organise all these components depending on the space available and the shape of the building.
Enginieering human resources are required to create, configure and install manitoring system.
Human resources may also be required to manipulate machines, connect each machine to the other and install network.

\subsection{Forces}

The forces of the project are mainly focused on the high effeciency of the production line.
This high effeciency is garanteed by the monitoring system and the automatic management of the amount of product produced on the assembly line.
This project represents a great opportunity to modernize the production of \moldco and automate the assembly line.
By automating the assembly line, \moldco gain a lot of money on storage of manufatured products and human resources.

\subsection{Weaknesses}

This project have also small weakness that may have an impact on risks
(Risk managment will be covered in the section \ref{risk-management}).

The main weakness are the important amount of advanced technologies that requires a great amount of high qualified employees in charge of the installing and maintaining the autonomous system of the assembly line.
Another weakness is the requirement of heavy and pricy machines that can represent a major part of the project's costs.
